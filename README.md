# scanMiRData

This package contains `KdModel` collections corresponding to all human, mouse and rat [mirbase](http:/mirbase.org/) 21.1 miRNAs.
These represent the miRNA 12-mer binding affinities predicted using the CNN from [McGeary, Lin et al. (2019)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aav1741).
To know more about the `KdModel` and `KdModelList` classes, see the corresponding vignette in the [scanMiR](https://github.com/ETHZ-INS/scanMiR) package.
